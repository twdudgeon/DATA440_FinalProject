## ℹ️ Overview

This fileset is meant to generate a dashboard on a tab using streamlit, which will then allow for a user to input a .CSV file. The code will then automatically clean the data such that it can then be processed to automatically create visualizations on a dashboard. This is intended specifically for .csv data from surveys, with a primary first column being questions and the rest being responses (review .CSV we used to see if this correct)

### 💭 Purpose

We created these files to help organizations automate the visualizations of large survey response data sets. This is meant to aid them in gaining a better understanding of their feedback without needing to comb through large sets of responses,hire a contractor to set up a visualization for them, or take time out of their work force to learn how to do so on their own.
